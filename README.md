# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

allowing us to make the gradient backround for the footer would be an interesting exercise.

divvying out the project tasks more evenly would help with planning from a time management standpoint.
